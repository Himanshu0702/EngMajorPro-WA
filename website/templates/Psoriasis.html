                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes a rash with itchy, scaly patches, most commonly on
                            the knees,
                            elbows, trunk and scalp. Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It
                            can be
                            painful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate.</p>
                        <p>
                            The condition tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding
                            for a
                            while. Common triggers in people with a genetic predisposition to psoriasis include
                            infections, cuts
                            or burns, and certain medications.

                        <h3>Causes.</h3>

                        <p>
                            Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem that causes skin cells to grow faster
                            than usual.
                            In the most common type of psoriasis, known as plaque psoriasis, this rapid turnover of
                            cells results
                            in dry, scaly patches.
                            The cause of psoriasis isn't fully understood. It's thought to be an immune system problem
                            where
                            infection-fighting cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake. Researchers believe that both
                            genetics
                            and environmental factors play a role. The condition is not contagious.
